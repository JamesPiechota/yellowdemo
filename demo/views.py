        When submitting a request to Yellow 3 additional header elements are
        needed:
        API-Key: your public API key, you can get this from your merchant
                 dashboard
        API-Nonce: an ever-increasing number that is different for each request
                   (e.g., current UNIX time in milliseconds)
        API-Sign: an HMAC hash signed with your API secret and converted to
                  hexadecimal. The message to be hahed and signed is the
                  concatenation of the nonce, fully-qualified request URL,
                  and any request parameters.
                       
        This allows us to authenticate the request as coming from you,
        prevents anyone else from modifying or replaying your request, and
        ensures your secret key is never exposed (even in a Heartbleed-type
        scenario where the SSL layer itself is compromised).
